# mtDNA-CNV
Trainee project at IGIB

From January 15, 2018 to May 31, 2018 I did my Bachelor's thesis for B.Tech. in Biotechnology from CISR-IGIB, under Dr. Vinod Scaria.

The topic of my thesis was 'Comprehensive analysis of Mitochondrial genome copy numbers from literature survey and re-analysis of NGS datasets'

That's exactly what I did. Mitchondrial genome copy number variation or mtDNA-CN is known to increase or decrease in case of diseased versus normal condtion (or tumor versus non-tumor in case of cancer).

The first part of my thesis is Literature Survey. I read dozens of paper to form the mtDNA-CNV compendium. 

Then I developed a pipeline to calculate mtDNA-CNV from NGS datasets.

Then I donwloaded publicaly available NGS datasets to get the theoratical mtDNA-CNVs.

Finally, I validated the results from Zhang et al.'s paper.


Result:

There wasn't a significant correlation between theoratical and real time PCR data. This suggests in turn that there might not be any correlation between mtDNA-CN and diseased condition, or maybe we cannot determine mtDNA-CN correctly from NGS data as claimed by various studies. More work is needed to confirm the findings.
